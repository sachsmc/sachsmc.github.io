    - title: "`plotROC`: Generate Useful ROC Curve Charts for Print and Interactive Use"
      path: https://sachsmc.github.io/plotROC/
      cran: plotROC
      shiny: https://sachsmc.shinyapps.io/plotROC/
      paper: https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v079c02
      description: Most ROC curve plots obscure the cutoff values and inhibit interpretation and comparison of multiple curves. This attempts to address those shortcomings by providing plotting and interactive tools. Functions are provided to generate an interactive ROC curve plot for web use, and print versions. A Shiny application implementing the functions is also included.
    - title: "`causaloptim`: An Interface to Specify Causal Graphs and Compute Bounds on Causal Effects"
      path: https://sachsmc.github.io/causaloptim/
      cran: causaloptim
      shiny: https://sachsmc.shinyapps.io/causaloptimweb/
      paper: https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2022.2071905/
      description: "When causal quantities are not identifiable from the observed data, it still may be possible to bound these quantities using the observed data. We outline a class of problems for which the derivation of tight bounds is always a linear programming problem and can therefore, at least theoretically, be solved using a symbolic linear optimizer. We extend and generalize the approach of Balke and Pearl (1994) <doi:10.1016/B978-1-55860-332-5.50011-0> and we provide a user friendly graphical interface for setting up such problems via directed acyclic graphs (DAG), which only allow for problems within this class to be depicted. The user can then define linear constraints to further refine their assumptions to meet their specific problem, and then specify a causal query using a text interface. The program converts this user defined DAG, query, and constraints, and returns tight bounds. The bounds can be converted to R functions to evaluate them for specific datasets, and to latex code for publication. The methods and proofs of tightness and validity of the bounds are described in a paper by Sachs, Jonzon, Gabriel, and Sjölander (2022) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2022.2071905>."
    - title: "`eventglm`: Regression Models for Event History Outcomes"
      path: https://sachsmc.github.io/eventglm
      description: "A user friendly, easy to understand way of doing event history regression for marginal estimands of interest, including the cumulative incidence and the restricted mean survival, using the pseudo observation framework for estimation. For a review of the methodology, see Andersen and Pohar Perme (2010) <doi:10.1177/0962280209105020> or Sachs and Gabriel (2022) <doi:10.18637/jss.v102.i09>. The interface uses the well known formulation of a generalized linear model and allows for features including plotting of residuals, the use of sampling weights, and corrected variance estimation."

    - title: "`xactonomial`: Exact Inference for Real-Valued Functionals of k-Sample Multinomial Parameters"
      path: https://sachsmc.github.io/xactonomial/
      description: "We consider the k sample multinomial problem where we observe k vectors
    (possibly of different lengths), each representing an independent sample from
    a multinomial. For a given function psi which takes in the concatenated
    vector of multinomial probabilities and outputs a real number, we are
    interested in constructing a confidence interval for psi. We use an exact (but 
    computational and stochastic) method to compute a confidence interval and a 
    function for calculation of p values. The details of the method will be in a 
    forthcoming preprint. "
    - title: "`stdReg2`: Regression Standardization for Causal Inference"
      path: https://sachsmc.github.io/stdReg2/
      description: "Contains more modern tools for causal inference using regression 
      standardization. Four general classes of models are allowed; generalized 
      linear models, conditional generalized estimating equation models, 
      Cox proportional hazards models and shared frailty gamma-Weibull models. 
      Sjolander, A. (2016) <doi:10.1007/s10654-016-0157-3>. Also includes functionality
      for doubly robust estimation for these model classes in some special cases. "

    - title: "`drsurv`: Doubly Robust Estimation of Survival Differences with Censored Data"
      path: https://sachsmc.github.io/drsurv
      description: "An implementation of several doubly robust estimators for the 
      survival difference at a given time point and one more complex 
      doubly robust estimator for the survival curve process. The estimators 
      are doubly robust in the sense that they are consistent if the censoring 
      model is correctly specified for censoring and either the outcome model 
      is correctly specified for confounding or the exposure model is correctly 
      specified for confounding. See <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2310.16207> for 
      more details and examples. "

    - title: "`testassay`: A Hypothesis Testing Framework for Validating an Assay for Precision"
      path: https://sachsmc.github.io/testassay/
      cran: testassay
      paper: https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.7528
      description: "A common way of validating a biological assay for is through a procedure, where m levels of an analyte are measured with n replicates at each level, and if all m estimates of the coefficient of variation (CV) are less than some prespecified level, then the assay is declared validated for precision within the range of the m analyte levels. Two limitations of this procedure are: there is no clear statistical statement of precision upon passing, and it is unclear how to modify the procedure for assays with constant standard deviation. We provide tools to convert such a procedure into a set of m hypothesis tests. This reframing motivates the m:n:q procedure, which upon completion delivers a 100q% upper confidence limit on the CV. Additionally, for a post-validation assay output of y, the method gives an “effective standard deviation interval” of log(y) plus or minus r, which is a 68% confidence interval on log(mu), where mu is the expected value of the assay output for that sample. Further, the m:n:q procedure can be straightforwardly applied to constant standard deviation assays. We illustrate these tools by applying them to a growth inhibition assay. This is an implementation of the methods described in Fay, Sachs, and Miura (2018) <doi:10.1002/sim.7528>."

      paper: https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2016-2/sachs-gabriel.pdf
      description: Contains the core methods for the evaluation of principal surrogates in a single clinical trial. Provides a flexible interface for defining models for the risk given treatment and the surrogate, the models for integration over the missing counterfactual surrogate responses, and the estimation methods. Estimated maximum likelihood and pseudo-score can be used for estimation, and the bootstrap for inference. A variety of post-estimation summary methods are provided, including print, summary, plot, and testing.
