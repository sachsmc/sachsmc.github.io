$$\lambda(t | x) = \lambda_0(t | x) \exp\{\gamma f(x)\}$$

where $f$ is a flexible function of exposure measured over time.

# Potential problems

- Bias!
    + Ignores measurement error in the exposure
    + Intermittent/incomplete measurement
- Inefficiency!
    + "Does not fully exploit dependence between ..." the exposure measurement process and survival. 
    
> In order to obtain an unbiased estimate of the effect of a covariate on an outcome variable using standard survival analysis methods, it is necessary that the covariate be measured at all times and without error.

# Joint modeling of repeated measurement and time-to-event data

### Terminology

- **Repeated measures:** Measurements belonging to the same subject but performed at different times. 
- **Measurement times:** Follow up times at which measurements are taken.
- **Measurement errors:** Difference between measured covariate and true value. 
- **Random effect:** Patient-specific coefficient that represents between-patient variability in the outcome that is not explained by covariates.

  # a 'graph' statement
  graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10]

  # several 'node' statements
  node [shape = box,
        fontname = Helvetica]
  eGFR; 'RRT/Censoring'; Covariate

  node [shape = circle,
        fixedsize = true,
        width = 0.9] // sets as circles

$$Y_{ij} = Y_i^*(t_{ij}) + Z_{ij} = X_{ij}\beta + W_{ij} B_i + Z_{ij}; \\\\
\lambda\{t | K_i, Y_i^*(t)\} = \lambda_0(t) \exp\{K_i \gamma_1 + Y_i^*(t) \gamma_2\}.$$

Estimate parameters by maximizing the likelihood.

## Data analysis

- Separate longitudinal model and survival models (Tables 2 and 3)
- Joint model (Table 4)


Stronger effect of GFR found in joint model compared to the separate models. Why was this surprising?

# Convenient transition quote

> Our analysis of time to initiation of RRT as the survival outcome alone, treating death as a right-censored event time, could be criticized for failing to take account of the status of RRT and death as asymmetrical competing risks...

## Multi-state models for event history analysis
### Per Kragh Andersen and Niels Keiding, 2002. SMMR

### Terminology 

- **Types of events (states) and times of occurrence**
- **Transitions from one state to another**
- **Absorbing state**: a state from which transitions cannot occur, otherwise **transient**


---

# Notation in simple model

![two-state.png](two-state.png)

Hazard = **transition intensity**
$$
\alpha(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{Pr(T \leq t + \Delta t | T \geq t)}{\Delta t}
$$

Survival = **Probability of not transitioning**
$$
S(t) = \exp(-\int_0^t \alpha(u) du)
$$

CDF = **Probability of transitioning**
$$
F(t) = \int_0^t \alpha(u) S(u) du = 1 - \exp(-\int_0^t \alpha(u) du)
$$

---

# In general

- **Multi-state process**: $(X(t), t \in \mathcal{T})$, taking possible values $\{1, \ldots, p\}$ (states). 
- **Covariates**: $Z(t)$, may also be independent of $t$ (i.e., baseline covariates only).
- **Transition probabilities**: $P_{hj}(s, t) = Pr(X(t) = j | X(s) = h, \mbox{history})$.
- **Transition intensities**:
$$\alpha_{hj}(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{P_{hj}(t, t + \Delta t)}{\Delta t}.$$

- **Markovian process**: if the transition probabilities only depend on $X(s)$ and not the entire history


---

# Test your understanding

In the two-state survival model: 

- What values can $X(t)$ take? 
- Is the process Markovian or not?
- How do we specify dependence on covariates? 

---

# More examples

- The competing risks model (Page 94)
- The illness death model (Page 95)
- Repeated events (Page 97)

---

# Model Specification and Estimation

## General strategy: 
- Specify model for $\alpha$
- Estimate by maximum likelihood
- Transform to get estimates of transition probabilities or other functionals of interest (**survival synthesis**)

$$f(t) = \alpha(t) S(t)$$

Therefore, once we specify models for the transition intensities, we can write down the likelihood (equation 2, page 99), and maximize it. 

### Key assumption about censoring:
> Individuals who are censored should have neither lower nor higher risk of future events than individuals who are not censored. 

Page 92.

# Models

## No dependence on covariates

1. Constant transition intensities (Page 100)
    - Estimates are simple proportions: the number of transitions from state $h \rightarrow j$ divided by the time in state $h$. 
2. Parametric models (Page 101, top)
3. Non-parametric models (Section 5.1.3)
    - Estimates are based on *Nelson-Aalen estimators* (equation 3)
    - Can obtain estimates of transition probabilities using product-limit method

---

## Regression models

1. Markov regression (Page 102, bottom)
    - For all pairs $h,j$, specify $\alpha^i_{jk} = \alpha_{hj0}(t) \exp(\beta_{hj} Z_i)$
2. Variations
    - $\alpha_{hj0}(t) = \alpha_{hj0}$ "Constant hazard"
    - $\alpha^i_{jk} = \alpha_{hj0}(t) + \beta_{hj}(t) Z_i$ "Additive model"
    - More parsimonious models: $\beta_{hj} = \beta_{hk}$, for example. 
    - ... or $\alpha_{hj0}(t) = \gamma \alpha_{hk0}(t)$
    - Frailty, random effects models: $\alpha^i_{jk} = \alpha_{hj0}(t) W^i_{hj} \exp(\beta_{hj} Z_i)$, where $W^i_{hj}$ is a random variable with mean 1

# PROVA data analysis

- Draw the model. 
- What are the models in table 2? 
- What are the models in Table 3? 
- What is the Markovian assumption and what evidence is there that it is violated? 
- How is that violation handled in Table 4?

# Software

> If separate baseline hazards and regression coefficients are assumed for each possible transition ... then the parameters may be estimated by fitting separate Cox or Poisson models for each transition. 

If not? Pages 108-109.

# Coming full circle

> Thus, if the model contains time-dependent covariates that are not purely endogenous ... A joint model for the multi-state process and the time dependent covariates is needed.

# Wrap up

- There exist many models beyond the Cox for time-to-event and longitudinal data, many of which can be estimated with standard software
- Think about your scientific model 
- Then think about the richness/limitations of your measurements
