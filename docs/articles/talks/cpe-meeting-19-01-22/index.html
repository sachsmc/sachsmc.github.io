# Introduction

How do we incorporate predictions into decision making?

---

# A simple decision tree

---

# Incorporating probabilities and utilities

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/util2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

# Analysis

Does using the prediction lead to reduced suffering, on average? 

- Utility values are personal and not easy to define, and may vary over time
- As with drugs, we don't expect predictions to benefit everyone, every time, only on averge.


---

# Challenges

1. Development and evaluation of prediction model
2. Determining possible actions (raincoat or umbrella)
3. Assessment of utilities
4. Generating evidence to support use/no use of the model

Two biomedical examples

---

# Oncotype DX

The TailorX trial

# Development Process Studies

1. Assay development
    - High dimensional RT-PCR assay
    - Literature review to identify candidate genes
    - Measure gene expression of about 250 genes
    - Demonstrate acceptible measurements in FFPE breast cancer biopsy specimens
2. Signature Development
    - Multiple studies to test associations between recurrence and genes
    - Number of genes whittled down to 16 plus 5 reference genes
    - Model estimated to combine genes into a recurrence score
3. Assay refinement
    - New assay developed to measure only the 21 genes
    - Validated and commercialized
4. Clinical validation
    - Independent study used to validate performance of score

Began entering clinical practice for prognosis, and sufficient evidence was gathered to motivate the trial

# Example 2: PSA Screening

ERSPC/PLCO

"The rate ratio of prostate cancer incidence between the intervention and control groups was 1.91 (95% CI 1.83-1.99) after 9 years. Despite our findings, further quantification of harms and their reduction are still considered a prerequisite for the introduction of populated-based screening."

# Lessons

1. Complexity as least as high as development of a new pharmaceutical treatment
2. Utility assessment is clearly distinct from the model development
3. Neither of these studies explicitly quantified the burden

# A future trial

# Questions of interest

1. Given an individual's current state and history (including covariates), can we accurately predict the probability of undergoing surgery within `\(t\)` years? 
2. Can that probability be modified by choosing an appropriate treatment? 

.content-box-red[Statistical challenges]

1. Complex multi-state model
2. Dynamic treatment regimes
3. Nebulous outcome

---

# Pseudo-observations

Let `\(\hat{\theta} = \int g(X) d\hat{F}(x)\)` denote our summary statistic of interest, where `\(\hat{F}(x)\)` denotes an estimate of the distribution of interest (e.g., time to surgery). 

.full-width[.content-box-blue[The `\(i\)`th pseudo-observation is 
`\(\hat{\theta}_i = n * \hat{\theta} - (n - 1) * \hat{\theta}^{-i}\)`
]]

### Properties 

- By construction: `\(E(\hat{\theta}_i) = E(\hat{\theta}) = \theta\)`
- Furthermore: `\(E(\hat{\theta}_i | X_i)\)` is asymptotically unbiased

The plan: Find an estimator for `\(\hat{\theta}\)`, calculate pseudo-observations, treat them as continuous outcomes in models dependent on covariates and treatments

# The estimator

]
.pull-right[
We use the Aalen-Johansen estimate for the cumulative incidence of surgery giving pseudo-observations that look like:

# Loss function estimation

For a given prediction `\(B_i\)` and pseudo observations of the cumulative incidences of cause `\(j\)`, `\(\hat{C}^i_j(t)\)`, we can estimate

`\(\widehat{TP}(t, c) = \frac{\sum_{i} \hat{C}^i_1(t) I(B_i &gt; c)}{\sum_{i} \hat{C}^i_1(t)}\)`

and 

`\(\widehat{FP}(t, c) = \frac{\sum_{i} (1 - \sum_{j=1}^3\hat{C}^i_j(t)) I(B_i &gt; c)}{\sum_{i} 1 - \sum_{j=1}^3\hat{C}^i_j(t)}.\)`

This yields an estimate of the cause-specific, time-varying area under the ROC curve. 

We find `\(B_i\)`, the function of baseline covariates, that maximizes this quantity

# Future work

1. Incorporating dynamic treatment observations in predictions
    - Time on or off treatment both an intermediate outcome and predictor of future states
2. More complex multi-state models
    - What is the appropriate loss function?
3. Using quality of life measurements
    - How do you feel on a scale from 1 - 100? 
    - Is this associated with choice of treatment or stage of disease? 
4. What information to provide and how?
    - To maximize utility
