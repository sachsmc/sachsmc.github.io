We model pseudo-observations based on the Aalen–Johansen estimator of the cause-specific cumulative incidence with an ensemble of modern machine learning approaches. Pseudo-observation preprocessing easily extends all existing or new machine learning procedures for continuous data to right-censored event history data. We propose pseudo-observation-based estimators for the area under the time varying receiver operating characteristic curve, for optimizing the ensemble, and the predictiveness curve, for evaluating and summarizing predictive performance.","","2019-08-25 05:43:44","2019-08-25 05:54:34","2019-08-25 05:43:44","","","0","0","","","Ensemble prediction of time-to-event outcomes with competing risks","","","","","","","en","© 2019 Royal Statistical Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","C:\Users\micsac\Zotero\storage\UM9Q3PA5\rssc.html","","Biostatistics","Competing risks; Crohn's disease; Inflammatory bowel disease; Machine learning; Pseudo-observations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
